                                Researchers at the NYU school of medicine have tested two drugs, trimipramine and fluphenazine, on model organisms that showed that these drugs do indeed decrease the propagation of this disease. However, there are some major pitfalls. It has not yet been tested on humans, even though these drugs are non-toxic. Additionally, this does not actually stop the disease, it just slows the development of the diseases, meaning that the disease will still develop, just at a later stage in life. Other than this, no other existing technologies to combat this disease has been found.

                        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">Small Molecule Treatment</h3>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                Current treatment ideas can be considered in three different categories - small molecule treatments, antibodies, and gene silencing. Small molecule treatments are currently being investigated with little result. These treatments involve inserting small molecules into the body via the bloodstream and then having them bind to prions and remove them from the body. These are currently considered the most viable form of treatment as small molecules can pass the blood brain barrier. 
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">Antibody Treatment</h3>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                Antibody treatments trigger an immune system response against proteins. Antibodies have a major fault in that most antibodies are larger molecules and cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, this treatment is extremely effective if the disease has not yet reached the brain. However, if the disease has already infected neurons in the brain, antibody treatments have shown no detectable improvement in symptoms and/or survival time. 
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">Gene Silencing</h3>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                The third idea is gene silencing, which is, in theory, a viable solution as it would inhibit the production of PrP and thus reduce the transmittance of the disease. Practically, this technology cannot currently be implemented because RNA or oligonucleotides cannot get through the blood-brain barrier and because the effects of reducing PrP production in the body have not been considered and tested in any research.
